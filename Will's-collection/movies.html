            <h1>Movies and TV</h1>
            <p>It may have started with books, but as soon as I could I ordered as many DvDs as I could. Some are Tv Shows, more are movies,
                but they're all enjoyable to me. I hope you enjoy them too.
            </p>

            <img src="Images/rsz_rango.jpg" alt="rango">
            <h4>Rango</h4>
            <p>Rango is one of those movies that's probably more important to me than to a general audience. It's a movie about a lizard who is 
                struggling to know who he is. He ends up in a wild west type place and they've run out of water their only currency. A series of events
                happen where Rango becomes sherriff and has to find out where the water has gone. It's a great movie because it has excellent animation.
                Nickelodeon movies just did it best back in the 2010s between this and the adventures of tintin I'd say it's looks amazing. It also is 
                incredibly funny with a sort of twisted sense of humor that just had me laughing all the way through, but make no mistake this movie has Some
                surprisingly emotional beats. The message of self discovery is one that comes only after probably the most well coreographed scene I've
                seen. The highway scene is just amazing and I'd say to watch it for that alone because it really speaks to the audience without saying anything at all.
                It's a little less appropriate than most of what I've shown so far, but it's still PG and I'd still recommend it.

            <h4>Avatar: The Last Airbender</h4>
            <p>It is incredibly difficult to put everything I want to say about avatar into one paragraph. I could probably fill web pages with
                most of the movies and books I have but this series is probably one of the best if not the best television series you could ever ask for.
                The series is about Aang, the avatar who is supposed to master all four elements: Water, Earth, Fire, and Air. He was going to do this over
                one hundred years before then but he got stuck in an iceberg and now he must do so before the arrival of sozin's comet. For that gives an unruly
                fire nation power to destroy the entirety of the world. The story is interesting enough on it's own, you have plenty of funny and memorable moments
                and it's nice to reflect on those. But what's been more important to me as of late is the themes that are throughout the show. A need for balance in ones
                life, not letting greed get in the way of the world. To own your past mistakes and grow from them. To be humble and to not let pride blind yourself.
                All are taught well in the series, simply enough to be understood by it's Y7 audience, but still executed excellently. It is an amazing series That
                this paragraph does not do justice. If I could make dropdown menus and such for pages I'd probably make a whole page for this and calvin and hobbes, but for now
                I pray it's something to convince ya to watch it again or for the first time.
