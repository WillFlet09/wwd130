            <h1>The Collection</h1>
            <p> Welcome to my collection! I've been collecting DvDs and books for a couple years now because I like owning what I enjoy.
                I consider everything in there to be relatively good and if not at least it's funny. I ain't pretentious enough to say it's 
                the best thing ever, but I do want to show people why I think it's good because I like to show people good media. There are
                two qualifications for this: it's meaningful in some way or it's funny as stated before. Neither preclude the other and I 
                don't think I have a meaningful movie without some funny moments, but these are the main two categories that define basically
                everything here, movies and books. 
                
                Some of these are very popular and some are a little more under the radar, but I want to show
                them all off because I think there might be something I can say about them. There is no good story without some sort of meaning.
                A story shouldn't be there for the sake of it, it should try to make us better in some way even if it is to make us laugh for a bit.
                It's what I've strived for even if some of it isn't as much so, but in any case I hope you enjoy it. </p>
