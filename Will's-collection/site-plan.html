      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My purpose would be to show off the collection of media I have and give my thoughts that I have really only told a small number of People
       and spread them more out to the web
      </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>People who like various movies, people who like various books, people who are willing to lend ear to me in this way. This media
        is relatively appropriate (somewhat the most the 80s and 90s can do appropriate). Usually if it's not funny it's meaningful in my Book
        and that is what makes good media.

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to my collection! I've been collecting DvDs and books for a couple years now because I like owning what I enjoy.
        I consider everything in there to be relatively good and if not at least it's funny. I ain't pretentious enough to say it's 
        the best thing ever, but I do want to show people why I think it's good because I like to show people good media. There are
        two qualifications for this: it's meaningful in some way or it's funny as stated before. Neither preclude the other and I 
        don't think I have a meaningful movie without some funny moments, but these are the main two categories that define basically
        everything here, movies and books. 
        
        Some of these are very popular and some are a little more under the radar, but I want to show
        them all off because I think there might be something I can say about them. There is no good story without some sort of meaning.
        A story shouldn't be there for the sake of it, it should try to make us better in some way even if it is to make us laugh for a bit.
        It's what I've strived for even if some of it isn't as much so, but in any case I hope you enjoy it.

      <h3>Books</h3>
      <p>
        Books are an entire half of this collection. Novels, comics, manga it's all there. A good chunk of my books are by Brandon Sanderson
        and a good chunk of the manga I have is One Piece. I just like fantasy I guess. It's more interesting to be able to think about another
        world rather than our own and it really heightens the escapism that books generally tend to provide. It's not just the other worlds however,
        even though it is what makes the genre special, good fantasy shows us heroes who rise to the challenge and are larger than all of us. heroes
        who make us want to try harder to better. It is a high bar to live up to, but it does work even if the content is a little less serious.
        Oddly it's the comics in this collection that make me think most about the world. Calvin and Hobbes and Lackadaisy would make anybody tend to
        think so, but it's interesting that something that is usually just seen as the funnies can actually get you to think critically about the world
        around you. As for the manga it does range from high fantasy to goofy fun and honestly that's how it should be. Nothing too stupid but not put 
        into too serious a light. Again it ties into it either being meaningful or funny and that's good enough for me.

      <h3>Movies-Tv</h3>
      <p>
        The whole other half of the collection and the top shelf is dedicated to movies and Tv Shows. This is where there is a bit more over the top adventure than the 
        books, but they do still come with meaning and if not they're what I like to call stoner movies. Stoner movies are the ones where you can turn your 
        brain off, but if they are good they're more wholesomely funny. This section has a lot more nostalgia so there definitely is much more bias here, however
        my opinions on this media already betrayed that fact. Animated or live action doesn't matter, I'm pretty sure it's enjoyable either way. The movies do tend
        to be on the older side but I have a few of the newer ones. I do have some TV shows, but those are fewer because they are so much more expensive than just getting
        a movie. I've got 2 anime, a kid's show and the complete series of avatar the last airbender, it's not much but I'm waiting until I'm in a better
        place for that. I mainly obtain DvDs when they're not availble to me in any other way which is why I have a lot more old and obscure stuff than
        the mainstream, but I'd highly recommend going for physical media for this reason.
