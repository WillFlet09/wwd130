            <p>This is the collection I have of books so far, enjoy.</p>

            <h4>Calvin and hobbes</h4>
            <img src="images/rsz_the_complete_calvin_and_hobbes.jpg" alt="calvin">
            <p>Calvin and Hobbes had become a cornerstone of comics in pop culture and it's not hard to see why. It's funny and heartfelt
                but it can also be enjoyed by everyone. Kids will probably see the comic as somewhat funny but be entertained more by the
                visuals. Adults will still enjoy the comic aspect, but be able to grasp more of the jokes and themes that are presented. Calvin
                and hobbes is about the connection between a boy and his stuffed tiger and their adventures together. With that description it might
                be odd to say that my main takeaway is that Calvin and Hobbes is at it's core about the connections of humanity to nature and childhood to adulthood.
                It's odd how much I see in this book that childhood can be more adult than we like, but moreso that adulthood is more childish
                than we think. Calvin and Hobbes shows this wonderfully mostly in jokes and such, but it's an interesting thing to see from it.
                I'd highly recommend this series of comics, it's clean and funny and it's a fine addition to any collection.

            <h4>Lackadaisy</h4>
            <img src="Images/rsz_lackadaisy.jpg">
            <p>Lackadaisy is a series of comics a bit more under the radar in my eyes, but one very much worthy of this collection. The 
                Story starts with Rocky, our sly and quickwitted protaganist who is part of a failing speakeasy in an alternate 1920s america.
                Rumrunning is what they did at least until the owner of the Lackadaisy speakeasy died. Now Rocky and company must try their best
                to keep this sinking business afloat or everything they've worked for will crumble harder than the crumbling of that old empire Lackadaisy.
                That's the summary of it for this volume but I do really like these comics. They're very accurate to the time of the 1920s, incorporating all sorts
                of older technology and slang that make it feel like it is really set in that time period. The art is also fantastic and it gets better and better
                as the comics go on. Sadly there are only two volumes physically with a partial volume three only online, but nonetheless this is a comic for any lover
                of cats, the roaring 20s and canadian whiskey. 
            </p>

            <h4>The Lost Metal</h4>
            <img src="Images/rsz_the_lost_metal.jpg">
            <p>The Lost Metal is probably the second best book of the mistborn saga and it's the last one to date. I'll try to give a spoiler free review here
                but there's probably going to be a spoiler section below inevitably to get more into why I love it. This is the second era of mistborn and the stakes
                have never been higher. Wax and Wayne have to fight against their old enemies the set, now imbued with the power of another God than the God of their planet
                and with plans that will shake the entirety of elendell to it's core. Broad strokes in summary I pray, the books are always funny with just the right amount of drama.
                The duality of Wax and Wayne is put to it's best here even when Wayne is semiserious, he's still not serious at all. Harmony is always great but that's because I liked him from
                books before. The magic system of allomancy is expanded on in all the right ways and is used in ways that most people don't tend to think of it seems. 
                Brandon Sanderson just does a great job at writing these and I'd recommend the entire series to anyone interested  
            </p>
            <details>
                <summary>Spoilers ahead, do not click unless you've read</summary>
                <p>Alright so that wasn't a great first paragraph. I am just really cautious about spoilers. Wax and Wayne are basically fighting against their plans to make an explosive
                    by seperating God Metals like a nuclear bomb. I can't even get into the best parts without spoilers because Wayne does die, but I think what Brandon Sanderson has done
                    best with mistborn is show the connection with a good God and his subjects. How Harmony really cares about his people and how this connects back to Wayne. Wayne is a character
                    that has been mostly there for the humor but he's put into a more serious light here. Wondering about his own mortality and how worthy he would really be of anything good happening
                    to him in any life to come. He sacrifices himself for elendell in a huge nuclear explosion just off the coast, but he was already worthy before that. He just needed this last push
                    and Harmony still welcomed him through with open arms. I'd recommend the entire mistborn series I've said it before and I'll say it again, but this book is behind the hero of ages
                    for how good it is to me.
